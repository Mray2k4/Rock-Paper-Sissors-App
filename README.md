### Summary
This project was really fun and challening at the same time. I learned a lot about the Math() method as well as the addEventListeners while building this app. The tough part for me was putting them together to get them to work. As I got deeper into the project things started getting a bit easier... meaning I was able to debug and problem solve faster once I got a rythme of how the code was supposed to work. With each project I see my skills improving from the previous one which makes me look forward to the next project.
